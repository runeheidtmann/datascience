## Dynamic news article generated with conditional tree
<b>Work project:</b> Survey into how we can make a dynamic system for generating news articles from data.
One solution is to have a conditional tree, that writes certain sentences when certain conditions are fullfilled.

## Make a robot draw 3d on 2d surface.
<b>Passion projekt:</b> I am very interested in generative art. The art of making algorithms do art. For this i have purchased a small robot arm, and
this is the very first survey into how to get from a dataset of coordinates down on to physical paper.
