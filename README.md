Work project: Survey into how we can make a dynamic system for generating news articles from data.
One solution is to have a conditional tree, that writes certain sentences when certain conditions are fullfilled.

## Make a robot draw 3d on 2d surface.
Passion projekt: I am very interested in generative art. The art of making algorithms do art. For this i have purchased a small robot arm, and
this is the very first survey into how to get from a dataset of coordinates down on to physical paper.
<b>Demonstration of my robot:</b>
